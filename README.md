### Description
This is a group project I have participated in as a developer. The goal of the project was to create a front-end app with the following functionalities:
- viewing the currently popular movies;
- viewing more information about the movie by clicking on it;
- adding a movie to the WATCHED LIST/QUEUE;
- removing a movie from the WATCHED LIST/QUEUE;
- searching for a particular title.

### My contribution
I was responsible for: 
- creating the modal window with details about the clicked movie;
- proofreading the code & comments written in English.
